# Snake-Game 🐍

A simple Snake game built with plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS — to improve my JS and DOM skills.

## ✅ What is this

- Classic Snake game where you control the snake using arrow keys  
- Eat food to grow the snake and increase score  
- Game ends if snake hits walls or bites itself  
- Shows score and keeps track of **high score** (stored in browser localStorage)  
- Timer counts how long you play  
- Option to restart after game over  

## 🧠 Why I built this

I made this project to practise:
- DOM manipulation  
- Event handling (keyboard events)  
- Arrays and objects in JS  
- Game logic: collision detection, movement, growth  
- Browser storage (`localStorage`) for high score  
- Basic UI and HTML/CSS  

## 🛠️ How to run

1. Clone or download the repo  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser  
3. Use arrow keys to move the snake  
4. Eat the “food” block to get points  
5. On game over — restart using the button  

## 📁 Files

- `index.html` — main HTML page  
- `style.css` — styles for game board, snake and food  
- `app.js` — main game logic (movement, food, score, collision)  

## 🚀 Features

- Snake movement + direction control  
- Food spawn at random positions  
- Score increments by 10 on eating food  
- High-score saved across sessions using `localStorage`  
- Timer tracking play time  
- Game over on wall hit or self collision  
- Restart button & UI modal on game over  

## 💡 Ideas to improve / Future work

- Make board size responsive (resize based on screen)  
- Add mobile/touch controls  
- Save and display full history of high scores  
- Add sound effects (eat, game over)  
- Add difficulty levels or speed increase over time  
- Add pause / resume feature
